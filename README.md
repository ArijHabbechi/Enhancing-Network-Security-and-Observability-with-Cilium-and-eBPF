# **Enhancing Network Security and Observability with Cilium and eBPF**

This project demonstrates how to enhance network security and observability in modern 5G and NFV (Network Function Virtualization) environments. Using **Cilium** and **eBPF**, the solution enables dynamic network policy enforcement, real-time traffic monitoring, and advanced visualization through tools like **Hubble** and **Grafana**.

---

## **Key Features**
- **Dynamic Network Policies**: Seamlessly enforce fine-grained policies to secure network communication and isolate workloads in Kubernetes.
- **Real-Time Traffic Monitoring**: Observe network flows with high performance using eBPF-based Hubble, reducing overhead while gaining deep insights.
- **Advanced Visualization**: Leverage Grafana for comprehensive dashboards and metrics to monitor system performance and security posture.
- **Optimized for 5G and NFV**: Designed to meet the high demands of 5G environments, including low-latency and high-throughput scenarios.

---

## **Technology Stack**
- **Cilium**: eBPF-powered networking for Kubernetes.
- **eBPF**: Efficient in-kernel observability and networking enhancements.
- **Hubble**: Network observability platform.
- **Grafana**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Kubernetes**: Container orchestration platform.
